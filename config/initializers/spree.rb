# Configure Spree Preferences
#
# Note: Initializing preferences available within the Admin will overwrite any changes that were made through the user interface when you restart.
#       If you would like users to be able to update a setting with the Admin it should NOT be set here.
#
# Note: If a preference is set here it will be stored within the cache & database upon initialization.
#       Just removing an entry from this initializer will not make the preference value go away.
#       Instead you must either set a new value or remove entry, clear cache, and remove database entry.
#
# In order to initialize a setting do:
# config.setting_name = 'new value'
#
# More on configuring Spree preferences can be found at:
# https://docs.spreecommerce.org/developer/customization
Spree.config do |config|
  # Example:
  # Uncomment to stop tracking inventory levels in the application
  # config.track_inventory_levels = false

  # Silence engine migration warnings - migrations live in engines and are
  # copied to db/migrate on demand, not checked into the backend app
  config.disable_migration_check = true
end

# Configure Spree Dependencies
#
# Note: If a dependency is set here it will NOT be stored within the cache & database upon initialization.
#       Just removing an entry from this initializer will make the dependency value go away.
#
# More on how to use Spree dependencies can be found at:
# https://docs.spreecommerce.org/customization/dependencies
Spree.dependencies do |dependencies|
  # Example:
  # Uncomment to change the default Service handling adding Items to Cart
  # dependencies.cart_add_item_service = 'MyNewAwesomeService'
end

Rails.application.config.after_initialize do
  # Role-based permissions
